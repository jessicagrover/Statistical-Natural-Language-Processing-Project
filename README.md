This project utilizes text analysis techniques to explore four classic literary works: "The Picture of Dorian Gray," "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland," "Dracula," and "The Republic." It involves preprocessing the text data, breaking it into chapters, and analyzing word frequencies using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm to identify underlying topics. The code segments cover tasks such as data retrieval, text preprocessing, topic modeling, and visualization. Visualizations include boxplots showing topic distributions within each book and heatmaps illustrating topic assignments across the corpus. Additionally, the analysis identifies chapters with dissimilar topic classifications compared to the overall book consensus, providing insights into thematic variations. The project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to textual analysis and serves as a valuable resource for exploring themes and concepts in classic literature through computational methods.
